Hi there, I am Yuankun Xie, currently a third-year Ph.D. candidate at the Communication University of China and engaged in joint Ph.D. training at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

My research interests encompass audio deepfake detection (both global and partial detection, as well as deepfake audio source tracing), speech synthesis, and voice conversion. I have published <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">20+</span> papers at the top international AI conferences and journals such as TIFS, IJCAI, ICASSP, INTERSPEECH.
